# Tug-of-War-vs-Computer
Add 3-bit counters for both players to track repeated Tug of War wins, along with a 10-bit LFSR to simulate a “cyber-player.” A comparator triggers the computer’s button presses if SW > LFSR. All logic operates on the same clock. The score increments with each win, and the playfield resets automatically.
