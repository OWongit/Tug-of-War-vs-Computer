# Tug-of-War-vs-Computer
 Add 3-bit counters for both players to track repeated Tug of War wins, plus a 10-bit LFSR to create a “cyber-player.” A comparator triggers the computer’s button presses if SW > LFSR. All logic shares the same clock. Score increments on each win, and the playfield resets automatically.
